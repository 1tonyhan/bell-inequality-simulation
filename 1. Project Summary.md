# Bell's Theorem and the CHSH Inequality
**Summer project - July 2025.**

In this project, I explore the basics of quantum computing and how experimentation around Bell's theorem (through qiskit and using IBM cloud server QPUs) demonstrates violation of classical behaviour - pointing to non-classical behaviour, namely, entanglement.  

For this project, I followed IBM Quantum Platform's CHSH experiment tutorial, which I have linked in my Resources Used.md file, along with all of the other resources I used for this project. 

**Here is a summary of the Bell theorem as I understand it:**

First, to set the stage: I will use the example of a particle with a spin of 0 that decays into two smaller, separate particles with spin up or down. For simplicity, I will call these particles A and B henceforth. I will also set the premise that there is an assumption of no other angular momentum other than spin in this situation; meaning spin is conserved. This is an ideal assumption and makes this topic easier for me to understand.

Imagine A and B end up in two completely different places, and are being observed by two different people. These two people will observe the particles and measure their spin along an axis - lets say the vertical Z axis for now. This intrinsic property of angular momentum, once measured in one particle, will reveal the spin of the other particle due to conservation - for example, if A is measured to have spin up along Z, B must be measured to have spin down along Z (and vice versa) since they decayed from a 0 spin particle. Their spins must add to 0. Okay, so this tells us very little; only that spin is conserved.

Now what if we set 3 axis of measurement rather than 1? Now, even with the measurement along any axis to be either up or down, there are a lot more possible combinations of measurements. Say the observers of A and B can choose to measure the spin of their particle along any of the 3 axes, independently of whichever axis the other observer chooses to measure along (recall they are really far away from each other, no communication!). Then, they send ONLY their value (either up or down) to a third observer. The observer recieves no information about which axis, only the spin state.

**Figure 1: 3 Axes to measure spin along; For simplicity, all axes are in the same plane, and separated by $120^{\circ}$**

One can postulate that in this case, there is a certain maximum probability that the values the third observer recieves are the same! What is this maximum probability?

Well we have two theories to explain this. One is hidden variable theory, or classical mechanics, and the other is quantum mechanics. What are any of these? I will try my best to explain that here:

**Hidden variable theory** is like a set of rules that A and B must obey. For example, one rule is that if A is measured to have spin up along Z, B must be measured to have spin down along Z. (provided they started from a spin 0 particle). With this logic, we can build a set of rules for these 2 particles A and B. Essentially, this set shows all the possible states of the axes for A, and then all the corresponding possible states of the axes for B. Below is an image of the set of rules for A and B on 3 measurement axes:

**Figure 2: Hidden Variable theory table**

<br />
From this table, we can obtain the possibilities that the observer recieves the same value from the people looking at A and B. Basically, in any given row, if you pick one of the three values from A, and one of the three values from B, the probability they are the same number is 4/9 for all but the cases in the first and last rows. So this is the maximum possibility that the observer recieves the same number from A and B, if hidden variable theory is followed; an upper bound in this theory <sup><a id="fn1-ref" href="#fn1">1</a></sup>.

<br />
<br />

**Now, for quantum mechanics:** it turns out, if we look at the quantum mechanics side of things, the probability that this observer recieves the same number from A and B can exceed 4/9! How does this happen?

Exceeding the probability value of 4/9 for measuring the same spin along any 2 axis is given by a bit of geometry and linear algebra stemming from something called a bloch sphere. 

I will explain the bloch sphere in a separate file**INSERT LINK HERE LATER!**, as it goes a bit more into the nitty gritty of things called qubits, which utilize this quantum behaviour to enable quantum computing!

Anyhow, from the bloch sphere, we get the behaviour that, in quantum mechanics, the probability of measuring the same spin along 2 axes X and Y, separated by an angle theta, is given by this formula:

$$P(same) = \cos^2(\frac{\theta}{2})$$

Going back to our example of 









**place below into a separate file**

For my purposes, I will not delve too deeply into how a bloch sphere works. Essentially, it is a way to represent quantum states in a more visually accessible way, to make it easier for our human brains to understand. Here is a brief explanation: 

A qubit or quantum state is represented by: 

$$\ket{\psi} = \alpha \ket{0} + \beta \ket{1}$$

where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are complex numbers! These two values are tied to probabilities of measuring $\ket{\psi}$ to be in one state or the other; $|{\alpha}|^2$ is the probability of measuring $\ket{\psi}$ in the state $\ket{0}$, and $|\beta|^2$ is the probability of measuring $\ket{\psi}$ in the state $\ket{1}$.

So theoretically, to represent a quantum state $\ket{\psi}$ as is, we would need some 4 dimentional graph... which is super hard to visualize. So researchers set out to find a better 'tool' to visualize these quantum states. 

Eventually, researchers were able to connect the work of physicist Felix Bloch to the geometric representation that is now commonly known today as the Bloch Sphere! (hence it being named after him).

I will not show the derivation of how the bloch sphere represents this, as that is not one of my goals for this project; it is also because I don't understand it well enough to feel confident explaining it.

Basically, through some elegant 'massaging' of the equation for $\ket{\psi}$, conversion to polar coordinates, then using euler's identity and geometry, the the form of a qubit can be represented as a vector in a 3d unit sphere. This vector only requires 2 parameters as opposed to the 4 we would need if we did not have the bloch sphere. These two parameters are $\phi$ and $\theta$. $\phi$ represents the angle between the positive x axis, and the vector's projection onto the x-y plane.  $\theta$ represents the angle between the positive Z axis and the vector itself.

If you are familiar with a 3d polar coordinate system, this is exactly the same concept!

**Figure 3: Bloch sphere coordinate system**

<br />

From the bloch sphere, the quantum state $\ket{\psi}$ can be written as such:

$$\ket{\psi} = cos(\frac{\theta}{2}) \ket{0} + e^{i \phi} sin(\frac{\theta}{2}) \ket{1}$$

where $0 \le \theta \le \pi$ and $0 \le \phi \le 2 \pi$

Okay, well now that we have this? What else can we know? well, we can write the point on the sphere as we would in any 3d coordinate system of (x, y, z) using the parameters $\phi$ and $\theta$:

$\ket{\psi}$ on the unit sphere (x, y, z) is: ( $sin \theta cos \phi$ , $sin \theta sin \phi$ , $cos \theta$ )

This is exactly the same as a 3d polar coordinate system!

This point has a corresponding unit vector (as do all points on the surface of the bloch sphere, as its radius is 1), that can be written: 

< $sin \theta cos \phi$ , $sin \theta sin \phi$ , $cos \theta$ >

We can now imagine that we have 2 axes we would like to measure along. Each one will be represented by a vector, which I will arbitrarily name X and Y. On the Bloch sphere, X and Y represent two quantum states. If I measure X, the probability of measuring Y to be in the same state as X is the **scalar projection** of X onto Y; that is, we are basically looking at how much of X is shared Y each other. Intuitively, this makes sense in relating to probability of the states being the same.

In terms of unit vectors, the scalar projection is simply given by $cos \theta$. However, $cos \theta$ exists on [-1, 1], which is not ideal as we are looking at probability; we want probability to be on [0, 1]. So we can normalize it as such:

$$P(same) = \frac{1+cos \theta}{2}$$
$$ \\{ P | 0 \le P \le 1 \\} $$

Now notice the form of this equation; it looks a lot like one of the half angle trigonometric identities: 

$$cos^2 \theta = \frac{1+cos(2 \theta)}{2}$$

So we can re-write:

$$P(same) = cos^2 (\frac{\theta}{2})$$


So given 2 axes X and Y separated by an angle $\theta$, the probability that Y is measured to be the same state as X is $cos^2 (\frac{\theta}{2})$!

[1] Here, I realized much later into the project that with IBM's tutorial, they recreate a more accessible experiment/visualization of bell's theorem with 3 axes rather than the original 2. I looked up the reason for this, and it was because scientists realized that with three equally spaces axes, measurements are rotationally invariant and generally more stable to test. This means the newer method is a lot more realistic to obtain results efficiently/effectively in the lab.  Why does this matter? with three angles, we have a different upper bound -
