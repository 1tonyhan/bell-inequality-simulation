****Here is a timeline of this project, for those why may be interested (dd/mm/yyyy):<br />****

  -30/06/2025 - Research of bell states, focus on tensor product and mathematical matrix representation of two qubit system states. Correlation and      anticorrelation. <br />
  -01/07/2025 - Research of bell states, how to create an entangled two qubit system using two qubits, a hadamard gate, and a CNOT gate. Learned how     the gates function. Matrix representation of CNOT gates, more linear algebra concerning qubit states. <br />
  -02/07/2025 - Basic proper notation of regular and superposition states, how the bell states are properly expressed in this notation. eg. |Φ⁺〉 = 
  |00〉 + |11〉 ) / √2 <br />
  -03/07/2025 - installation and learning of how to use qiskit and python, and how to link to IBM cloud servers to access real quantum hardware. <br />
  -07/07/2025 - Research of Bloch Spheres to improve understanding of quantum states. <br />
  -07/28/2025 - Research of the CHSH Inequality: more experimentally friendly version of the Bell inequality <br />

Here, I was on vacation with my family (I went to various places in France and Italy!), and then school started, where I started focusing on my studies more. I resumed this project much later after adjusting to my engineering physics workload, and finishing my first round of midterms.
  
  -10/23/2025 - Review of the CHSH experiment, using the IBM video. Followed the IBM tutorial and set up a virtual environment .venv for a jupyterNotebook, and actually performed the CHSH experiment on IBM QPUs by linking my IBM quantum platform account to the code. Plotted results.
  -10/25/2025 - Updated this ReadMe file, and further consolidated my understanding of how the upper bounds for hidden variable theory vs quantum mechanics was determined. I am still slightly confused about the quantum mechanics upper bound, so I will revisit tomorrow. <br />
  -10/26/2025 - Research about bloch spheres continued <br />
  -10/28/2025 - More research about bloch spheres, trying to find where the cosine probability formula for same spin on 2 axes comes from <br />
  -10/30/2025 - With the help of a uni professor, figured out roughly how bloch spheres work and where the probability formula comes from.
