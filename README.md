#Welcome to my CHSH project! I have a few files, and I have numbered them in the order you should read them!

<br />

The first file contains the summary of the project, which is essentially what I learned. I think the learning process was definitely tedious at first, but it got interesting quite quickly. In this file,
I explain the way the CHSH experiment works, in the way I understand it from my self studies. 

<br />

The second file contains the list of resources I used. This is self explanatory.

<br />

The third file contains a timeline which I update every time I work on this project! 

<br />

the rest are just supplementary files, including a folder for all the images I have used - these are all made by me either in excel, goodnotes, or other software.
I will also include my jupyter notebook which has all the code I used to actually complete this simulation using IBM QPUs through their quantum platform.
